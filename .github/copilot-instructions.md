- **Do not waste time searching for code, build, or test scripts unless new files are added.**

## AI Usage Prompts for Students (Assignments and Exercises)

When updating lesson materials, add short AI-usage prompts that align with CTD's AI policy and encourage active learning. These prompts should guide students to think first, explain reasoning, and use AI for feedback, hints, and clarification rather than answers.

### Core Principles

- **Active learning over passive prompting:** Students should explain their own reasoning, then ask for feedback.
- **AI as a teaching assistant, not an answer key:** Encourage hints, debugging help, and concept checks.
- **Validation:** Remind students to verify AI guidance with official docs and testing.
- **No AI during technical assessments:** Coderbyte and other assessments prohibit AI use.

### Prompt Types to Include

**Retrieval Practice (Explain in your own words):**

- Ask students to explain a concept in their own words, then ask AI to critique and refine.
- Example prompt: "I just learned about [concept]. Here is my understanding: [your explanation]. What did I get right, and what should I refine?"

**Predict-then-Check:**

- Ask students to predict output or behavior before running code, explain why, then verify.
- Example prompt: "Looking at this code: [paste code]. I predict it will [prediction] because [reasoning]. Am I correct? If not, what am I misunderstanding?"

**Scaffold Removal (Hints only):**

- Ask AI for high-level hints or questions rather than solutions.
- Example prompt: "I am stuck on Task 3. Can you give me 3 high-level hints without giving the answer?"
- Example prompt: "I am seeing this error: [error]. Ask me 3 questions to help me solve it on my own."

### Policy Reminders to Embed Where Relevant

- **Intro-level guidance:** Do not use AI to write code for you. Use it to clarify concepts, explain your own understanding, or get hints.
- **Advanced-level guidance (React/Node/Python):** If a student copies AI-generated code, they must add a code comment and include AI attribution in the submission form, explaining what was used and how it was modified.
- **Cross-checking:** Encourage students to compare AI guidance with official docs and reputable sources.
- **Discernment:** Remind students AI can be wrong or outdated; they must run and test any AI-assisted code.

### Additional Encouraged Uses

- **Time management prompts:** Help students break work into smaller tasks or plan catch-up schedules.
- **Translation prompts:** Allow students to request translations or simplified explanations in their native language.

## Weekly AI Prompt Planning Pattern

Use this pattern when adding AI prompts for weekly materials so materials remain consistent between weeks.

### Discussion Pattern

- Add a section titled **Check Your Understanding with AI** near the end of `discussions.md`.
- Include a short 4-step flow:
  1. Explain in your own words from memory.
  2. Ask AI for critique and gaps.
  3. Revise explanation.
  4. Compare against lesson examples/docs.
- Include **4 example prompts** ordered to match the week's concept sequence.
- Format example prompts as an **unordered list inside a markdown quote block**.
- Add policy reminder language: AI should provide feedback and hints, not complete solutions.

### Assignment Pattern

- Add a final section (or final subsection block) that includes:
  - **Test Your Application**
  - **Checkpoint: Check Your Understanding with AI**
  - **Version Control and Submission**
- In the checkpoint, include **4 prompts** and direct students to choose 1–2 and generate one of their own.
- Format checkpoint prompts as an **unordered list inside a markdown quote block**.
- Keep prompts tied directly to assignment tasks and expected app capabilities.
- Add policy reminder language as a **NOTE callout** immediately before prompts. Use this default text unless week-specific wording is needed:
  - `>[!NOTE]`
  - `>Do not ask AI to complete the assignment code for you.`
- Keep reminder intent consistent: explain first, then request feedback; avoid answer-generation requests.

### Prompt Quality Rules

- Prioritize retrieval practice, prediction, and reasoning checks over code generation.
- Anchor prompts to that week's lesson order (earlier concepts appear first).
- Keep language concise and beginner-friendly.
- Ask for critique, corrections, or follow-up questions rather than final code.

### Weekly Review Checklist Additions

When reviewing weekly content updates, verify:

- `discussions.md` includes one **Check Your Understanding with AI** section.
- `assignment.md` includes one **Checkpoint: Check Your Understanding with AI** section in final steps.
- Prompt count and ordering follow this pattern unless a week-specific rationale is documented.
- Prompt content aligns with CTD AI policy and the week's learning objectives.

## CTD Swag Demo Application Reference

When building code examples for weekly discussions, **ALWAYS** reference the comprehensive CTD Swag documentation in `references/demos-context/CTD-Swag/`:

### Available Reference Materials

- **COMPONENTS.md** - Complete list of 21 React components with architecture details
- **HELPER-FUNCTIONS.md** - Complete list of 25+ helper functions organized by purpose
- **CUSTOM-HOOKS.md** - Analysis of React hooks usage (Note: No custom hooks currently implemented)

### Code Example Guidelines

**Use Authentic CTD Swag References When:**

- Demonstrating component extraction patterns (Cart/CartItem, ProductList/ProductCard)
- Showing helper function examples (getCartPrice, sortByBaseName, filterByQuery)
- Illustrating component organization (features/, layout/, pages/, shared/)
- Teaching refactoring concepts with real-world context

**Label Hypothetical Examples When:**

- Creating examples not currently in CTD Swag
- Demonstrating concepts beyond the current application scope
- Introducing new patterns for educational purposes

**Required Labeling for Hypothetical Examples:**

```jsx
// Hypothetical example - not currently implemented in CTD Swag
function useShoppingCart() {
  // Custom hook logic...
}
```

### Architectural Consistency

**Follow CTD Swag Patterns:**

- Event handlers: `handle*` prefix (handleAddItemToCart, handleAuthenticate)
- Calculations: `get*` prefix (getCartPrice, getTotal)
- Component organization: Feature-based directory structure
- Props naming: Consistent with existing patterns (baseName, itemCount)

**Built-in Hooks Usage (No Custom Hooks):**

- useState (8 instances in App.jsx, multiple across components)
- useReducer (cart state management)
- useEffect (lifecycle and side effects)
- useCallback (memoization in App.jsx)
- useRef (Footer component year reference)
- useParams, useNavigate (React Router)

**Educational Value:**

- Maintains consistency with established demo application
- Provides realistic, implementable examples
- Builds upon student's existing knowledge base
- Shows authentic component extraction scenarios

## When Performing a Code Review

- You are a React curriculum writer who is experienced in web development and React.
- Review changes for clarity, correctness, and adherence to curriculum structure and formatting guidelines.
- Identify gaps in the materials that that would be helpful for junior developers to know.
- Ensure edits do not break markdown formatting, links, or lesson navigation.
- The repo does not use TypeScript or TSX.
- Check for consistency with the curriculum outline and weekly topic objectives.
- Flag any missing, unclear, or out-of-scope changes for further review.
- Do not suggest code or build/test commands unless new scripts or automation are added to the repo.
- Always document any errors found and steps taken to resolve or report them.

## Technical Validation Section

### React Code Examples Validation

- **JSX Syntax**: Verify all JSX code is syntactically correct and follows React conventions
- **Component Structure**: Ensure proper component definition, export statements, and naming conventions
- **Props Consistency**: Check that props passed match props received across all component examples
  - Verify prop names are consistent (e.g., `baseName` vs `name`)
  - Ensure all required props are passed and documented
  - Check for prop destructuring alignment
- **Hook Usage**: Verify hooks follow Rules of Hooks (top-level, function components only)
- **Component Naming**: Ensure consistent naming across files and references

### Cross-Reference Validation

- **Component Names**: Check that component names match between file names, function names, and imports
- **File References**: Verify all file paths and component references are accurate
- **Code Continuity**: Ensure code examples build logically from previous examples

## Error Categories and Severity Guidelines

### Critical Errors (Fix Immediately)

**These break student workflow and prevent code from functioning:**

- Syntax errors in code examples
- Props mismatch between parent and child components
- Missing or incorrect import/export statements
- Component naming inconsistencies that break references
- Incorrect hook usage that violates Rules of Hooks
- Missing required dependencies or setup steps

### Important Errors (Fix Before Publication)

**These cause confusion but don't break functionality:**

- Unclear or ambiguous instructions
- Inconsistent terminology across lessons
- Missing context or prerequisites
- Outdated screenshots or visual aids
- Broken internal links between lessons
- Component names that don't match between text and code

### Minor Errors (Address in Next Review Cycle)

**These are cleanup items that improve quality:**

- Typos and grammar issues
- Inconsistent formatting
- Missing alt text for images
- Code style inconsistencies
- Outdated external links
- Missing or incomplete comments in code examples

### Review Prioritization Guidelines

1. **Critical errors halt review**: Fix immediately before proceeding
2. **Important errors cluster**: Address all in the same section before moving on
3. **Minor errors batch**: Collect and fix together at the end of review
4. **Document patterns**: Note recurring error types for process improvement
